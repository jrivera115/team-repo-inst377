        Many individuals are unaware of the potential health concerns that exist
        in regards to food served at various foodservice facilities. Because of
        this, there have been cases of mass food poisioning for multiple food
        service facilities, making it important to find a method to inform
        people of facility inspection results. This way, people will be able to
        make a decision as to what they want to eat as they consider previous
        inspection results. In hopes to inform these individuals, our
        application, Safety Zone, will bring about food safety awareness by
        generating food places that comply or fail to comply within a certain
        mile radius of the user's location. The application will begin by asking
        the user to input a Zip Code or City address. The input will be used to
        retrieve a colelction of sorted data that will reveal food services that
        are tagged with varying levels of food inspection compliance results.
        Then, these user will be able to filter the inspection results through
        various categories.
