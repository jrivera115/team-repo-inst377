        Many individuals are unaware of the potential health concerns that exist
        in regards to food served at various foodservice facilities. Because of
        this, there have been cases of mass food poisoning for multiple food
        service facilities. By providing a method that will inform people of
        facility inspection results, people will be able to make easier
        decisions in regards to what they would want to eat.

        For our team, each one of us had visions and/or goals that we wanted to
        be carried out with this project. Many of us are food-enthusiasts and
        were interested in looking at food inspection results data since it is
        relevant to us when it comes down to what restaurants we want to pick
        when choosing where we want to eat. Our initial thought that we had to
        target this problem was providing an easier method that would show us
        relevant restaurant data all in one place. Food applications such as
        Yelp only provide general information about restaurants such as its
        name, location, 5-star rating, and reviews. Our group wanted to target
        our information problem and take it one-step further by adding facility
        inspection results. In addition, we wanted to specialize our application
        by our own food interests which can be seen through the filter options
        that will categorize the food restaurants based on food type.

        In hopes to inform these individuals, we will be solving our information
        problem by creating an application, titled <b>Safety Zone</b>. <b>Safety Zone</b>,
        will bring about food safety awareness by generating food places that
        comply or fail to comply within a certain mile radius of the user's
        location. Our application will help users identify food service
        facilities nearby, as well as basic information about these facilities
        such as prices, type of food, customer reviews, etc. Our results will
        display an updated record of their food inspection results, allowing
        users to know whether the food service facility they have chosen has
        been found to be in violation, and if so, if actions must be taken in
        order to address it. Our application will help users make an informed
        choice about which food service facilities to go to. Our application
        will target the general public and those who are most affected by food
        service facilities that are found to be in violation. We hope to inform
        our audience of food safety awareness with Safety Zone. The application
        will begin by asking the user to input a Zip Code or City address. The
        input will be used to retrieve a colelction of sorted data that will
        reveal food services that are tagged with varying levels of food
        inspection compliance results. Then, these user will be able to filter
        the inspection results through various categories.
