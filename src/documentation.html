    <p>Welcome to <b>Safety Zone</b>, A Place to Eat Clean! The steps to use our application are easy! Beginning at our Index page, the user will be presented with a search bar and a toggle button below. The toggle button will allow the user to switch between inputting a City or a Zip Code within PG County for a particular restaurant he or she may be looking for. After typing in their input, the user will click the search button (i.e. the magnifying glass) on their keyboard to be taken to an output of their results.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="box2">
    <p>At the results page, the user will see an image of PG County on their left and a location indicator of where on the map the City or Zip Code that they inputted is located. On the right, there will be an interactive list of restaurant names that will be located within that City/Zip Code area. When the user clicks on a specific Restaurant Name, the Restaurant Name and its statistics retrieved from the database we are using will be displayed. Statistics may include the Address and Date of the inspection in addition to a hyperlink that will lead to the official restaurant page. The checkbox on the left of the data table will display whether or not that restaurant was in violation of the food safety inspections in a particular given year.</p>
