Safety Zone 

<Description of Project>
Many individuals are unaware of the potential health concerns that exist in regards to food served at various foodservice facilities. Because of this, there have been cases of mass food poisioning for multiple food service facilities, making it important to find a method to inform people of facility inspection results. This way, people will be able to make a decision as to what they want to eat as they consider previous inspection results. 

In hopes to inform these individuals, our application, Safety Zone, will bring about food safety awareness by generating food places that comply or fail to comply within a certain mile radius of the user's location. The application will begin by asking the user to input a Zip Code or City name. The input will be used to retrieve a collection of sorted data that will reveal food services that are tagged with varying levels of food inspection compliance results.

<Developer Manual (bottom half of your README.md)>

The audience of this document is future developers who will take over your system
They know technical terms and have general knowledge about web applications, but do not have knowledge about your system design.
You need to provide a technical document so that future developers can start setting up the application on their local machines, and keep working on the system development after you leave the team.
Your Developer Manual covers:
How to install your application and all dependencies
How to run your application on a server
How to run any tests you have written for your software
The API for your server application - all GET, POST, PATCH, etc endpoints, and what they each do
A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development.
