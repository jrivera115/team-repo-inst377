**Safety Zone**

Many individuals are unaware of the potential health concerns that exist in regards to food served at various foodservice facilities. 
Because of this, there have been cases of mass food poisioning for multiple food service facilities, making it important to find a method 
to inform people of facility inspection results. This way, people will be able to make a decision as to what they want to eat as they 
consider previous inspection results. 

In hopes to inform these individuals, our application, Safety Zone, will bring about food safety awareness by generating food places 
that comply or fail to comply within a certain mile radius of the user's location. The application will begin by asking the 
user to input a Zip Code or City address. The input will be used to retrieve a colelction of sorted data that will reveal food services 
that are tagged with varying levels of food inspection compliance results. Then, these user will be able to filter the inspection results 
through various categories.

Our application has been built on Heroku, a cloud platform that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications.  https://safetyzone-demo.herokuapp.com/
