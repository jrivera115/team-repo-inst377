Safety Zone is an application that allows users to access food inspection results for food service facilities in a specific area.
First, users can choose in the search bar whether to input a zip code or a city name. After inputting either 
a zip code or a city name, they can press the search button to search for food service facilities in that area. The results page will
include a map with markers indicating the location of all food service facilities in the chosen area, as well as a display containing the names of said facilities as well as their most recent food inspection and the results of it.
