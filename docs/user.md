Safety Zone is an application that allows users to access food inspection results for food service facilities in a specific area.
First, users can choose in the search bar whether to input a zip code or a city name. After inputting either 
a zip code or a city name, they can press the search button to search for food service facilities in that area. The results page will
include a map with markers indicating the location of all food service facilities in the chosen area, as well as a display containing the names of said facilities as well as their most recent food inspection and the results of it. The user can then choose to input another zip code or city name if they wish. Safety Zone also has a navigation bar where users can navigate to our "About" page which contains our rationale behind creating Safety Zone, or the "Documentation" page which contains an explanation of how to use Safety Zone.
