Safety Zone is an application that allows users to access food inspection results for food service facilities in a specific area.
First, users can choose in the search bar whether to input a zip code or a city name by toggling a switch. After inputting either 
a zip code or a city name, they can press the search button to search for food service facilities in that area. The results page will
include three components. The first is a map of the area selected, with the locations of the food service facilities identified on it.
The second is a list of all the food service facilities with basic information about them. The third is a list of the food inspection
results for each of these locations, including if they passed the inspection and if not, why they failed.
