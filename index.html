      <p> When people decide to go to foodservice facilities to eat food, often they are unaware
                of potential health concerns regarding the food that is served there. Because of this, there have been cases of
                mass food poisoning from various food service facilities, as the food they eat has been contaminated at some point.
                Thus, it is important to find a method to inform people of the results of facility inspections, so that they can make
                decisions of what to eat while considering previous inspection results and the reasons behind the findings of violations. 
                While customers can search for this information online, it can be somewhat difficult, especially for lesser-known food
                service facilities, as the information in question is often difficult to access. Because of this, there is a need for a
                method to quickly lookup past inspections of food service facilities done by the government, and whether or not the foodservice
                facility has been approved as a safe place to eat.</p>
            <p>Our application will generate restaurants that either comply or fail to comply within a certain mile radius of the user's location. 
                We hope to inform the general public of food safety awareness using our application.</p>
